# Shape

## My attempt to implement shape-like on the site https://www.cedricpereira.com/

### Implemented by

- Scene
- Convert svg to an array of coordinates (used separately)
- Drawing an array of shapes
- Shape shaping through the use of new coordinates
- Shaping a shape around a scene
- Cursor interaction
- Fill the shape with a texture or a single color
- Transitions from one fill to another (animated)

### Planned functionality

- Physical model
- Interaction between shapes
- Revise api for Shape and Scene classes
- Implement scaling shapes on stage
- Optimize shape rendering

# Build project

- Run comand "parcel index.html" in project directory
- Open http://localhost:1234 in browser
